- Which sales method (In-store vs. Outlet) generates the highest revenue across all products?
- What is the average operating margin across all product categories?
- How does the total revenue change across different weeks or months?
- Which region contributes the most to the total sales, and does it align with the highest profitability?
- Are there specific dates or weeks when certain products experienced a significant spike or drop in sales?
- Which product category has the highest operating profit across both sales methods?
- What is the average profit margin for products sold via In-store vs. Outlet methods?
- Which product had the lowest operating margin, and how can this be improved?
